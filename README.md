## Overview

This repository contains the HR Analytics Dashboard, a powerful tool designed to provide comprehensive insights into various aspects of human resources data within an organization. The dashboard visualizes key HR metrics, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions related to workforce management, employee satisfaction, compensation, and attrition.

## Key Features

The dashboard is built to offer a quick and insightful glance into:

* **Work-Life Balance Ratings:** Understand employee sentiment regarding work-life balance.
* **Job Role Distribution:** Visualize the proportional representation of different job roles within the organization.
* **Monthly Income by Job Role:** Compare income levels across various job functions.
* **Overall Attrition Rate:** Monitor employee turnover and retention.
* **Employee Demographics:** Gain insights into total job levels, education levels, job satisfaction, and monthly income across the organization.
* **Interactive Filters:** Analyze attrition by age range and job level for deeper insights.

## Dashboard Sections & Metrics

The dashboard is logically divided into several sections, each focusing on a critical HR area:

### Top-Level Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* **Sum of Job Level:** Aggregate measure of job levels across the workforce.
* **Sum of Education:** Cumulative measure of educational attainment of employees.
* **Sum of Job Satisfaction:** Overall employee satisfaction score.
* **Sum of Monthly Income:** Total monthly compensation disbursed to employees.

### Employee Well-being

* **Work-Life Balance Ratings:** A donut chart showing the distribution of work-life balance scores (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). A significant portion of employees report a balance rating of '3' (60.41%), indicating a generally healthy work-life environment.

### Workforce Demographics & Compensation

* **Job Role Distribution:** A treemap visualization displaying the proportion of employees in various job roles. "Sales Executive" and "Research Scientist" appear to be the most prevalent roles.
* **Monthly Income by Job Role:** A bar chart comparing the sum of monthly income for different job roles. "Sales Executive" demonstrates the highest monthly income, followed by "Manager" and "Manufacturing Director".

### Attrition Analysis

* **Overall Attrition Rate:** A pie chart showing the percentage of employees who have attrited versus those who have not. The dashboard indicates an attrition rate of 16.12%.

    * **Attrition (Yes/No):** Filter to view only attrited or non-attrited employees.
    * **Age Range (18-60):** Analyze attrition trends across different age groups.
    * **Job Level (1-5):** Investigate attrition rates for specific job levels.
